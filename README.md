# Road Segmentation for Self-Driving Cars

Objective: The global market for self-driving cars has been on a rise with the market size projected to grow from 20.3 million units in 2021 to 62.4 million units by 2030, a CAGR on 13.3%. Among the many challenges associated with designing self-driving cars, one challenge that we are particularly interested in is designing a machine learning model that can accurately detect road lanes. In this project I have created an image segmentation model that tries to accurately identify the pixels corresponding to the road from a given dash cam image.
